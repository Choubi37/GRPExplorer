# GRPExplorer

supports:
  - browsing the bigfile file system
  - unpacking the bigfile into individual files
  - repacking individual files into one bigfile 
        (hasn't been tested on the lastest version of the game, only the beta version)

also contains a unity project that you can use to import and view textures from the game.  i was planning on adding everything required to browse the maps before i got caught up with other projects, but the basic architecture required is there.

you will need a version of unity (only tested with 2018.3).  drop the UnityEngine and UnityEditor dlls into the `bin` folder.
